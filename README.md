Order pizza with react, redux and GraphQL.

## Getting started

This project was built with:
```bash
node v8.2.1
yarn v0.24.6
```


Install packages with yarn or npm

```bash
yarn

npm install
```

Start the express and webpack servers in development
```bash
yarn start
```

You can now check out the app on port 8000 - http://localhost:8000/

To run the app in production:

```
then
```bash
yarn prod:start
```

stop the production server with:

And thats it! Enjoy, and remember - pineapple has no place on a pizza.
